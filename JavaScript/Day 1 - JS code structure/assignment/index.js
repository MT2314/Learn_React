/* 
Instructions
Before starting make sure to run the assignment using WAMP or MAMP. You can just open the index.html file directly, but there is a chance that your PC CORS system will not allow for javascript files to run on non https web apps.
For the assignment:
1. Fix variables that are not using the proper naming system. For example, no camelCase or using special characters that are not "$" or "_" for naming.
2. Some of the lines on the editor are meant to be comments, comment it out.
3. The current code in this file is out of order, re-order it. You will know that the code works properly when the HTML app works correctly.
*/

This is the main index js file that will contain most of the code for the counter app to work properly.

// imports

variables for the code
const count! = document.querySelector('#count');
const increasecountbutton = document.querySelector("#increaseCountButton");
const currentCount = [0];

// functions
increaseCount(increaseCountButton, count);
const decrease count button = document.querySelector("#decreaseCountButton");
decreaseCount(decreaseCountButton, count);

import decrease-count from './decreaseCount.js';

exports
export default currentCount;
import increase Count from './increaseCount.js';
